# attendance_system
This project is an AI-based Face Recognition Attendance System that automatically identifies people from a video or camera feed and records their attendance in a CSV file. It uses the InsightFace (Buffalo-L) deep learning model for accurate face detection and recognition.

The system first enrolls faces from images, stores their facial features securely, and then recognizes registered faces in real time from a video or webcam. Attendance is marked automatically with time, date, entry type (IN/OUT), and confidence score.
